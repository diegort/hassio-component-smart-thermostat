# Smart Thermostat with auto Heat/Cool mode, PID control and PWM (Home Assistant component)

Thermostat was designed to control different kind of entities (not only switchable like in [generic_thermostat]).

### Supported domains and modes for heaters and coolers:

* `switch`, `input_boolean` - Basic on/off like [generic_thermostat] or PWM mode.
* `climate` - PID regulator.
* `number`, `input_number` -  PID regulator (additional switch is required).

### Current features:

* Support multiply heaters/coolers.
* Supports `heat_cool` mode.
* Supports all Home Assistant preset modes
* Supports invert logic of the heater/cooler.
* Protection if target sensor does not report values for period of time (`sensor_stale_duration`).

## Installation (via HACS)

This is recommended way, which will handle one-click upgrade in HACS.

1. Install [hacs] if it is not installed.
2. Open HACS -> Integrations. Click 3 dots in the upper right corner.
3. Click Custom repositories.
4. Add `https://github.com/jethome-ru/hassio-component-smart-thermostat` repository.
5. Find `Smart Thermostat with auto Heat/Cool modes and PID control support` and click install button.

## Installation (Manual)

NOTE: This is not recommended way, because you will need to upgrade component manually. 

1. Copy `/custom_components/smart_thermostat` to your `<config_dir>/custom_components/` directory.

   * On HassIO the final location will be `/config/custom_components/smart_thermostat`.
   * On Supervised the final location will be `/usr/share/hassio/homeassistant/custom_components/smart_thermostat`.
   * _NOTE: You will need to create the `custom_components` folder if it does not exist._

1. Restart Home Assistant Core.

## Example configurations

### Minimal working config example
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: smart_thermostat    
    name: kitchen_thermostat

```

## Glossary

* `target_temp` - Climate target temperature, can be changed in UI. Initial can be set via `target_temp` config option.
* `cur_temp` - Current sensor temperature. Will be reported by `target_sensor` entity.
* `CONFIG.xxx` - Reference to the config option.
* `CONFIG.CONTROLLER.xxx` - Reference to the config controller option (**heater/cooler**).

_NOTE: at least one of `heater` or `cooler` is required._

## Common behavior

Initial HVAC mode can be set via `initial_hvac_mode` config option.

Thermostat behavior will depend on active HVAC mode. HVAC mode can be set in UI. 

_**NOTE: Smart thermostat will always take full control of the heaters/coolers. 
So it will turn them on/off back if you change their states manually**_

### HVAC_MODE = `heat`
_NOTE: available if at least one `CONFIG.heater` was defined._

* All **heater** controllers will be turned on. Specific behavior of each **heater** will depend on the controller type.
* All **cooler** controllers will be turned off.

### HVAC_MODE = `cool`

_NOTE: available if at least one `CONFIG.coller` was defined._

* All **cooler** controllers will be turned on. Specific behavior of each **cooler** will depend on the controller type.
* All **heater** controllers will be turned off.

### HVAC_MODE = `heat_cool` 

_NOTE: available if at least one `CONFIG.heater` and at least one `CONFIG.cooler` were defined._

* If `cur_temp >= target_temp + CONFIG.heat_cool_hot_tolerance` 
  * All **cooler** controllers will be turned on.
  * All **heater** controllers will be turned off.
  * Specific behavior of each heater/cooler will depend on the controller type.


* If `cur_temp <= target_temp - CONFIG.heat_cool_cold_tolerance` 
  * All **heater** controllers will be turned on.
  * All **cooler** controllers will be turned off.
  * Specific behavior of each heater/cooler will depend on the controller type.

_NOTE: turning on controller **DOES NOT MEAN** turning on `CONFIG.CONTROLLER.enitity_id` inside controller. 
Controller behavior depends on the **specific controller logic** and described below for each controller._


## Controllers

Specific controller will be created for each `heater`/`cooler` config option based on `CONFIG.CONTROLLER.enitity_id` domain. 

### Switch controller (ON/OFF)

Domains: `switch`,`input_boolean` 

#### Config options

* `entity_id` _(Required)_ - Target entity ID.
* `inverted` _(Optional, default=false)_ - Need to invert `entity_id` logic.
* `keep_alive` _(Optional)_ - Send keep-alive interval. Use with heaters, coolers,  A/C units that shut off if they don’t receive a signal from their remote for a while. 
* `min_cycle_duration` _(Optional, default=null)_ - Minimal cycle duration. Used to protect from on/off cycling.
* `cold_tolerance` _(Optional, default=0.3)_ - Cold tolerance.
* `hot_tolerance` _(Optional, default=0.3)_ - Hot tolerance.

#### Behavior

* Turn on `entity_id` if `cur_temp <= target_temp - cold_tolerance` (heater) or `cur_temp >= target_temp + self._hot_tolerance` (cooler)
* No `entity_id` changes will be performed if config `min_cycle_duration` was set and enough time was not passed since last switch.
* Behavior on/off will be inverted if `inverted` config option was set to `true`

### PWM Switch PID controller

Domains: `switch`,`input_boolean`.

See [General PID explanation](docs/PID.md) how to tune PID parameters.

* Internal PID limits are integers, defined as constants `PWM_SWITCH_MIN_VALUE` and `PWM_SWITCH_MAX_VALUE` (0, 100).
  So, you must use this limits when tuning `pid_params` terms. 

#### Config options

* `entity_id` _(Required)_ - Target entity ID.
* `inverted` _(Optional, default=false)_ - Need to invert `entity_id` logic.
* `keep_alive` _(Optional)_ - Send keep-alive interval. Use with heaters, coolers,  A/C units that shut off if they don’t receive a signal from their remote for a while. 
* `pid_params` _(Required)_ - PID params comma-separated string or array in the format `Kp, Ki, Kd` (_Always positive, will be inverted internally for cool mode_).
* `pid_sample_period` _(Optional)_ - PID constant sample time period.
* `pwm_period`  _(Required)_ - PWM period. Switch will be turned on and turned off according internal PID output once in this period.  

#### Behavior

* PID output will be calculated internally based on provided `pid_params`.
* `pwm_period` will be separated to two parts: `ON` and `OFF`. Each part duration will depend on PID output. 
* PWM on/off need will be checked every `pwm_period/100` time **but not often than each 1 second**. (`PWM_SWITCH_MAX_VALUE` internal const variable)
* Behavior on/off will be inverted if `inverted` config option was set to `true`.
* It is keep on/off state duration before Home Assistant restart. Last change time is saved in thermostat state attributes.

NOTE: This mode will be set if entity domain is one of the listed above and `pid_params` config entry is present.

### Climate controller (PID mode supported)

Domains: `climate`

See [General PID explanation](docs/PID.md) how to tune PID parameters.

#### Config options

* `entity_id` _(Required)_ - Target entity ID.

* `min` _(Optional)_ - Minimum temperature which can be set. Attribute `min_temp` from `entity_id` will be used if not specified.
* `max` _(Optional)_ - Maximum temperature which can be set. Attribute `max_temp` from `entity_id` will be used if not specified.

#### Behavior

* Climate `entity_id` will be turned on when controller is active.
* Climate `entity_id` will be turned off when controller is not active.
* Climate `entity_id` temperature will be adjusted every `pid_sample_period` it is provided, or on every `CONFIF.target_sensor` update if `pid_sample_period` is not provided.
* `pid_params` will be inverted if `inverted` was set to `true`

### Number + Switch controller (PID mode supported)

#### Config options

* `entity_id` _(Required)_ - Target entity ID.
* `inverted` _(Optional, default=false)_ - Need to invert `entity_id` logic.

* Switch `switch_entity_id` will be turned off when controller is not active.
* Number `entity_id` temperature will be adjusted every `pid_sample_period` it is provided, or on every `CONFIF.target_sensor` update if `pid_sample_period` is not provided.
* `pid_params` will be inverted if `inverted` was set to `true`
* `switch_entity_id` behavior will be inverted if `switch_inverted` was set to `true`
